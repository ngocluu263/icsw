Monitoring Settings
=======================

Here, you can change basic monitoring settings.

You can define custom **monitoring periods**, allowing you to define custom notification settings based on the time of monitoring event. 

You can change who should receive which notifications during specific monitoring periods.

You can change how frequent services are checked, the notification intervals etc. using **service templates**. You can also configure the check behaviour on a **device template level**. 

To commit changes, you have to rebuild the monitoring config.
