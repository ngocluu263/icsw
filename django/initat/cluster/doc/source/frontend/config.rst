Configurations
=======================

Here, you can create, delete and modify configuration of **v**\ ariables, **m**\ onitoring and **c**\ onfig scripts.

For monitoring, the command follows the typical Nagios check command syntax, e.g. *$USER1$/check_http -H $HOSTADDRESS$*

You can download your current configuration using the **download button**, and import an configuration by uploading an appropriate XML file.

Please note the possibility to filter configurations by name in the top row.

If you want to delete a configuration, you have to delete all variables, monitoring configs and config scripts first.
