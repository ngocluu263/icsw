Device Configuration
=======================

Here, you can change the mapping of configurations to devices. For example, to activate a monitoring command to be carried out for a device, you need to expand by clicking **config** and to enable the specific check button. You can enable a check for a group of devices by using the respective **METADEV_groupname**. 

To commit changes, you have to rebuild the monitoring config.
