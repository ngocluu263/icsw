Networks
=======================

Here, you can create, delete and modify networks. Information about the networks existing in an infrastructure is required for a device to be integrated. 

Click on **exp** on the left side to expand more detailled information about a network you want to manage. 

If you create a network, you need at least a catchy identifier, and the network, netmask, broadcast and gateway address.

Once you have created a network, you can configure devices to be a member of a network in  :ref:`device_networks`.
