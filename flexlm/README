Introduction.

   The Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* is a network license manager
   that allows licenses to be available (floating) anywhere on a network,
   or allows licenses to be available only on a locked set of hosts
   (node-locked HOSTID list).

   The three main components of the Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm*
   are the license data file, the license manager daemon, lmgrd.intel,
   and the vendor daemon, INTEL.

License Data File.

   The license file contains information about the SERVER and VENDOR
   daemons (if necessary), and data for each licensed product (such as
   expiration dates, number of licenses available, etc.).  Licenses are
   provided for each of your products, but edited and installed by you.

   When a product starts up, whether by direct invocation or by an
   indirect call (e.g., as the result of 'make') the license file is
   checked for valid license data.  The product must know where to find
   the license file.

   The license file placed in the "/opt/intel/licenses" directory of the
   product installation directory becomes the default, and the environment
   variable:
   
      INTEL_LICENSE_FILE
   
   should be set to point to this file.

   In most products a short shell script is used as the entry to exec-
   ution and the environment variable INTEL_LICENSE_FILE is set just
   before execution begins.  In this case the enduser need not know where
   the license file is located.

The Licensing Daemon lmgrd.intel.

   The lmgrd.intel is the master daemon; it starts the VENDOR daemon,
   INTEL.  The lmgrd.intel daemon handles the initial contact with the product.
   If you have received a "counted" license then both daemons must be running
   in order to execute this product.

The VENDOR Daemon INTEL.

   The INTEL daemon keeps track of how many licenses are checked out,
   and what users have them (unless the licenses are uncounted, in which
   case the product need only read the license file to execute and NO
   daemons need to be running).

Adding the Daemon to the Start-up File.

   This installation may have done the server startup for you.  The
   daemons reside in the flexlm subdirectory of the installation direct-
   ory; and were started with the C-shell commands:

      cd <installation-directory>
      `pwd`/lmgrd.intel -c `pwd`/server.lic -l `pwd`/lmgrd.intel.log

   To avoid restarting the daemons, lmgrd.intel and INTEL, each time the
   system is rebooted, you may modify your boot startup script to start
   the daemons.

   The file

      lmgrd.intel.rc

   created for counted licenses during configuration will contain the
   Bourne shell startup line that should be added.

      IMPORTANT NOTE:  It is strongly recommended that
                       this start up not be done by root.
                       Please see the FLEXlm* End User
                       Manual Appendix D.3.6-7.

The Options File.

   The Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* allows the use of an "options"
   file.  This file is used by the local system manager to control FLEXlm*
   licensing options (such as what items are entered into the log file,
   or, to restrict usage to named groups of users).  See the "FLEXlm* End
   Users Guide" for details concerning "options" files.
    



The Install_INTEL Configuration Script.

   When you first run the product configuration script the Install_INTEL
   script is also executed so no other steps may be required.
   However, this script may be executed standalone to configure the
   Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm*.

   When you have received your license data, begin the license configura-
   tion process by executing the commands:

      cd <installation-directory>
      ./Install_INTEL

   Install_INTEL is an interactive script.  If you are installing a
   license file it will take you through the following steps:

      1)  Entering your license data.  After creating the FLEXlm*
          utility soft links ("lmcksum", "lmdiag", etc) the script will
          accept your licensing data in two ways.  The script will read
          a license file you already have created on line (either in
          the installation flexlm directory as ./server.lic or
          any other convenient location), or the script will enter one
          of the EDITORs available to you for manually creating the
          file.  An lmcksum checksum will be calculated for the license
          file you have indicated or created.  If the checksum is BAD
          you will have an opportunity to correct the license data.
          The file is stored in the installation directory as:

             <installation_directory>/server.lic

      2)  Installing the license file.  An attempt may be made to place
          the new license file in the INTEL default license file
          location:

             /opt/intel/licenses/server.lic

          If the license file CANNOT be placed in this default, the
          <installation_directory>/server.lic file will be
          used as the default license file.  This means that in
          the small shell calling scripts the environment variable
          is assigned as:

             INTEL_LICENSE_FILE=${INTEL_LICENSE_FILE:+${INTEL_LICENSE_FILE}:} \
                "<installation_directory>/server.lic"
             export INTEL_LICENSE_FILE

          If the licenses are "uncounted" the products will execute
	  (since no daemons are needed for license management).

      3)  Optionally Starting the license manager.  You may instruct the
	  script to attempt to start up the license manager daemons for
	  "counted" licenses.  It will use the commands:

             cd <installation_directory>
             `pwd`/lmgrd.intel -c `pwd`/server.lic -l `pwd`/lmgrd.intel.log




Installing Daemons on Different Architectures.

   In more sophisticated FLEXlm* installations, it may be desirable to run a
   FLEXlm* license server on a platform other than the one for which your
   software has already been downloaded.  FLEXlm* servers for the various
   platforms used with Intel(R) products are available for separate download.




FLEXlm* Version Compatibility.

   When combining license files for two different FLEXlm* licensed prod-
   ucts, it may be that those products do not use the same versions of
   FLEXlm*.  The solution is to always use the newest version of 'lmgrd'
   (this may not be lmgrd.intel -- the license manager supplied by Intel(R))
   and the Vendor daemons.  Always use the newest FLEXlm* utilities as well. 




Combining Multiple License Files.

   When you are running FLEXlm* licensed products from one vendor, or from
   multiple vendors, you may need to take steps to prevent licensing
   conflicts.  Note that vendors may have their own copies of 'lmgrd', the
   licensing daemon.  These daemons may be renamed to create unique names
   (lmgrd.intel is an example).  Conflict may be avoided in three ways:

      a) Multiple license SERVER nodes; each running one license manager
         ('lmgrd' or its renamed version) reading one license file.

      b) One license SERVER node running one license manager reading
         one (or more) license files.

      c) One license SERVER node running multiple license managers
         reading one (or more) license files.

   If the license files for two or more products contain identical hostids
   on the SERVER lines, then these files can be combined.  If the files
   contain different hostids on a SERVER line, then the license managers
   for those products will be running on different nodes and the license
   files cannot be combined.

   If your license files are compatible, then you have the option of com-
   bining license files into one file and running a single license manager
   ('lmgrd') reading this file.  If the license files are not compatible,
   then you must run separate copies of the license manager for each file.

   You are not required to combine compatible license files; you always
   have the option of running separate license managers for each vendor.




Combining License Files.

   All Intel(R) products licensed with FLEXlm* Version 7.x (or later) have
   default license file location:

      /opt/intel/licenses

   If this location and file are available to you then combining Intel(R)
   product license files should be considered.

   Simply collect all the license files for identical SERVER lines into
   one file; remove any identical lines and place this file in the default
   location (/opt/intel/licenses).  [Re]start lmgrd.intel with the command:

      cd <installation_directory>
      `pwd`/lmgrd.intel -c /opt/intel/licenses/server.lic -l `pwd`/<newlogfile>





Redundant Servers.

   FLEXlm* supports redundant SERVERS.  With three-SERVER redundancy, if
   any two of the three license servers are up and running, the system is
   functional and issues all licenses available (Two out of three license
   SERVERs is referred to as a "quorum").

   If all data, input and output, and all executables are on a single file
   SERVER, then there is no need for redundant SERVERs, and it is recom-
   mended that a single SERVER node for the FLEXlm* daemons be used. If
   these resources are split among two or more SERVER nodes and work is
   possible when one of these goes down or off the network, then multiple
   SERVER nodes can be employed.  In all cases, an effort should be made
   to select stable systems as SERVER nodes.  It is not required that the
   SERVER nodes be the same architecture or operating system.
   
   If you wish to employ redundant servers, a license must be provided for
   you that specifies the three SERVERs you wish to use.



Trouble-shooting.

   Entering License File Data.

      You can edit the hostname on the server line (first argument),
      the port address (third argument), the path to the vendor-daemon
      on the VENDOR line (if present), or any right half of a string
      (b) of the form a=b where (a) is all lower case.  Any other changes
      will invalidate the license.
   
      Be cautious when transferring date received by Mailers.  Many
      Mailers add characters at the end-of-line that may confuse the
      reader about the real license data.
   
   
   Use the 'lmdiag' utility.

      This command analyzes a license file with respect to the SERVER,
      the FEATUREs, license counts and dates.  It may help you to under-
      stand problems that may occur.  'Lmdiag' attempts to checkout all
      FEATUREs and explains failures.  You may run extended diagnostics
      attempting to connect to the license manager on each port on the
      host.
   

   Use INTEL_LMD_DEBUG environment variable

      Setting this environment variable will cause the application to
      produce product diagnostic information at every checkout.
   
   
   Daemon Startup Problems.
   
      Cannot find license file
         Most products have a default location in their directory
         hierarchy (or use /opt/intel/licenses/server.lic).  The
	 environment variable INTEL_LICENSE_FILE names this directory.
	 Startup may fail if these variables are set wrong, or the
	 default location for the license is missing.
   
      No such feature exists
         The most common reason for this is that the wrong license
         file, or an outdated copy of the file, is being used.
   
      Retrying socket bind
         This means the TCP port number is already in use.  Almost always,
         this means an lmgrd.intel is already running, and you've tried to
         start it twice.  Sometimes it means that another program is 
         using this TCP port number.  The number is listed on the SERVER 
         line in the license file as the last item.  You can change the
         number and restart lmgrd.intel, but only do this if you don't already
         have an lmgrd.intel  running for this license file.
   
      INTEL: can't initialize
      (INTEL) FLEXlm version 9.2
      (lmgrd) Please correct problem and restart daemons
         You may be starting the lmgrd.intel from the wrong directory, or with
         relative paths.  Use:
	      cd <installation-directory>
	      `pwd`/lmgrd.intel -c `pwd`/server.lic -l `pwd`/lmgrd.intel.log
	 in the start up and add a full root path to 'INTEL' to the end of the
	 VENDOR line in the license file.

      License manager: can't initialize: Cannot find license file
         You've started lmgrd.intel on a non-existent file.  The recommended
	 way to specify the file for lmgrd.intel to use -c <license>:

	    cd <installation-directory>
	    `pwd`/lmgrd.intel -c `pwd`/server.lic -l `pwd`/lmgrd.intel.log

      Invalid license key (inconsistent encryption code for 'FEATURE')
         This happens for 3 different reasons:

            1. The license file has been typed in incorrectly
               (cutting and pasting from email is a safe way to
               avoid this).  Or the data have been altered by
               the enduser.  See "Entering License File Data"
               above.

            2. The license is generated incorrectly.  Your vendor
               will have to generate a new license if this is the
               case.

            3. The license vendor has changed encryption seeds
               (rare).
   
      MULTIPLE vendor-daemon-name servers running
         There are 2 'lmgrd' and vendor-daemons running for this license
         file.  Only one process per vendor-daemon/per node is allowed
         to run.  Sometimes this can happen because the  'lmgrd'
         was killed with a -9 signal (which should not be done!).  The
         'lmgrd' was then not able to bring the vendor-daemon process
         down, so it's still running, although not able to serve licenses.
         If 'lmgrd' is killed with a -9, the vendor-daemons also then must
         be killed with a -9 signal.  In general, 'lmdown' should be used.
   
      Vendor daemon can't talk to 'lmgrd'
         This means a pre-version-3.0 'lmgrd' version is being used with
         a 3.0+ vendor daemon.  Simply use the latest version of 'lmgrd'
         (MUST be a version equal to or greater than the vendor daemon
         version).  This can also happen if TCP networking doesn't
         function on the node where your're trying to run 'lmgrd' (rare).
   
      No licenses to serve
         The license file has only 'uncounted' licenses, and these don't 
         require a server.  Uncounted licenses have a '0' or 'uncounted'
         in the 'number-of-licenses' field on the FEATURE line.
   
      Other
	 Starting lmgrd.intel from a remote directory may lead to unknown
	 results.  If lmgrd.intel is started from a remote directory the
	 license file line:

	    VENDOR INTEL

         should be modified to include the root directory where the
	 'INTEL' vendor daemon resides:

	    VENDOR INTEL <root-directory-path>

         The lmgrd.intel daemon MUST be started with the -c argument

	    cd <installation-directory>
	    `pwd`/lmgrd.intel -c `pwd`/server.lic -l `pwd`/lmgrd.intel.log
   
   Application Execution Problems.
   
      Cannot connect to license server
         Usually this means the server isn't running.  It can also mean
         the server is using a different copy of the license file, which
         has a different port number than the license file you're cur-
         rently using indictes.  You can use the 'lmdiag' utility to more
         fully analyze this error.
   
      License server does not support this feature
         This means the server is using a different copy of the license
         file than the application.  They should be synchronized.  This
         error will also report "UNSUPPORTED" in the debug log file.
   
      Invalid host
         You may be attempting to run the application on a host not
         listed in the "HOSTID" field of your license.  Use 'lmhostid'
         to find the hostid number for the current host. 
   
      Cannot find license file.  No such file or directory
      Expected license file location: <path>
         The application was not able to find a license file.  It gives
         you the location(s) where it was looking for a license file.
         Check that the named file exists.  To use a file at a different
         location, use the environment variable INTEL_LICENSE_FILE.
   
      No such feature exists
         The license manager cannot find a 'FEATURE'  line in the license
         file.
   
      Feature has expired
         Your license has expired.  The system time may be set incorrectly.
         Run the 'date' command to make sure the date is not later than
         the Expiration Date listed in the license file.

      <FEATURE name>: Invalid (inconsistent) license key
         The license-key and data for the feature do not match.  This
         usually happens when a license file has been altered.  See
         "Entering License File Data" above.

   
   
   System Bootup Problems
   
      For reasons unknown some bootup files (/etc/rc, /sbin/rc2.d, etc)
      refuse to run 'lmgrd' with the simple commands indicated above (see
      "Adding the Daemon to the Start-up File").  Here are two work-
      arounds:

         1. Use 'nohup su username -c 'umask 022;lmgrd -c ...''
               (It is not recommended to run 'lmgrd' as root;
               the "su username" is used to run 'lmgrd' as a
               non-privileged user.) 

         2. Add 'sleep 2' after the 'lmgrd' command.
