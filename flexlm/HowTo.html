<H1 align="center"><B>HowTo For Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm*</B></H3>

The Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* controls per-seat licenses, node-locked
licenses, one-platform-type floating licenses, all-platform-type licenses,
and node-locked, unlimited users licenses.

<H3 TOC="Before Installation"><a name="Before Installation"></a>Before Installing the Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm*</H3>

<H4 TOC="Check License"><a name="Check License"></a>Ensure that you have license data</H4>

<P>You should already have a license file containing the
license data for the product you wish to run.
If this license contains at least one <b><code>PACKAGE</code></b> line,
at least one <b><code>FEATURE</code></b> line,
at least one <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line,
and at least one <b><code>VENDOR</code></b> line containing the word <b><code>INTEL</code></b>,
then it is a counted license that requires a license server.
Licenses that are not counted (i.e., do not have <b><code>SERVER</code></b> and <b><code>VENDOR</code></b> lines)
do not require a license server.
</P>

<H4 TOC="Edit License"><a name="Edit License"></a>Create the new-license-data-file</H4>

<P>
On the system where you will be installing the Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm*,
create a file that contains only the multi-line license data you wish to use.
Be sure to include all 
<b><code>SERVER</code></b>,
<b><code>VENDOR</code></b>, 
<b><code>PACKAGE</code></b> 
and <b><code>FEATURE</code></b> lines (and their
continuation lines). 
<p>
This document refers to this file as the
<b><code>new-license-data-file</code></b>. 
The <b><code>new-license-data-file</code></b>
must be a normal ASCII text file. </P>

<H4 TOC="Use Guru"><a name="Use Guru"></a>Use your local FLEXlm* guru if you have one</H4>

<P>Many large sites have central facilities for dealing with FLEXlm*
licenses. If your site is one of those, give a copy of the license
data to your local FLEXlm* support person, and let them perform
their installation magic. Then skip to the 
<!-- <A HREF="#Installation">Install the License Server</A> section.</P> -->
<A HREF="#Install License Server">Install the License Server</A> section.</P>

<H4 TOC="Daemon Check"><a name="Daemon Check"></a>Determine if you need license manager daemons</H4>

<P>Examine the license data. If you have at least one line beginning
with the word <b><code>SERVER</code></b> and at least one line beginning with
the word <b><code>VENDOR</code></b>, which contains the word <b><code>INTEL</code></b>, then you will need the 
license manager daemons.
If the license data does not contain these lines, then you will
not need the license manager daemons, and you can skip to the
<!-- <A HREF="#Installation">Install the License Server</A> section.</P> -->
<A HREF="#Install License Server">Install the License Server</A> section.</P>

<P>Login to the machine identified by the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line of
the license data. See if a license manager daemon is already running
that serves Intel(R) FLEXlm* licenses by executing the following command:</P>

<PRE><B>    ls /usr/tmp/.flexlm/lockINTEL</B></PRE>

<P>If this file does exist, then there should be license manager daemons
running that are serving Intel(R) FLEXlm* licenses. Go to the section on <A
HREF="#Adding">adding license data to an existing license file</A>.</P>

<a href="Installation"></a>
<H3 TOC="Install License Server"><a name="Install License Server"></a>Install the License Server</H3>
<p>
Login to the machine where the Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* will be installed.
Note that if you need license manager daemons, 
this need not be the same machine as the one identified
on the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line.
<P>
The installation process will ask you if the license data to be used with
the server is stored in a file.  Answer <B>y</B> and enter the full path
to the new license file data.
<P>
Complete the installation process.

<P>The installation process will place a copy of 
<B><CODE>new-license-data-file</CODE></B>
into the <B><CODE>server.lic</CODE></B> file in the
Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* installation directory.</P>

<P>
If the license data does not contain a <B><CODE>SERVER</CODE></B>
or a <B><CODE>VENDOR</CODE></B> line, then you are done.</P>
<P>
Otherwise you may have to

<H3 TOC="Daemons"><a name="Daemons"></a>License Manager Daemons</H3>

<H4 TOC="Status"><a name="Status"></a>Determining if the Daemons are running</H4>
<p>
<b><code>cd</code></b> to the directory where the
Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* is installed. Use the following command to
determine if the license manager daemons are running:
<pre><b>    ./lmstat -c server.lic</b></pre>

If the license manager daemons are running, you will see output that
looks something like:
<PRE><B>    Flexible License Manager status on Mon ...</B>
<B>    License server status: ...</B>
<B>       License file(s) on &lt;server&gt;: &lt;full-path-to-a-file&gt;</B>
<B>       &lt;server&gt;: license server UP (MASTER) v9.2</B>
<B>    Vendor daemon status (on &lt;server&gt;):</B>
<B>        ...</B>
<B>        INTEL: UP v9.2</B></PRE>
If you see an output that looks like this, check:
<ul>
  <li>the license server is <b><code>UP</code></b> 
  <li>the license server has a version number 
      greater than or equal to <b><code>v9.2</code></b>
  <li>the <b><code>INTEL</code></b> is listed under the
      vendor daemon status section
  <li>the <b><code>INTEL</code></b> is <b><code>UP</code></b> 
  <li>the <b><code>INTEL</code></b> has a version
      number greater than or equal to <b><code>v9.2</code></b>
</ul>
If the output <b><code>./lmstat</code></b> passes all of these checks, 
then you are done.  You should read the sections on
<a href="#StartingDaemons">starting</a> and
<a href="#StoppingDaemons">stopping</a>
license manager daemons, 
unless your site has a FLEXlm* guru to handle these tasks.
<p>
If the output <b><code>./lmstat</code></b> looks close to
the above sample output, but fails one or more of the checks, 
then there is a problem that needs to be resolved, and you need
<a href="#Need Help">help</a>.
<p>
If the license manager daemons are not running, 
the output from <b><code>./lmstat</code></b> 
will look something like:
<pre><b>    License server status: ...</b>
<B>       License file(s) on &lt;server&gt;: &lt;full-path-to-a-file&gt;</B>
<b>    lmgrd is not running: Cannot connect to license server ...</b>
<b>    (Connection refused)</b></pre>
The license manager daemons must be running in order to use your product.
First, make sure that you have the correct daemons
for the <b><code>SERVER</code></b>s platform type.

<H4 TOC="Downloading"><a name="Downloading"></a>Getting the Correct Daemons</H4>

<P>If the system identified on the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> 
line of the license
data is not the same platform type as the machine where your product
is installed (that is, one is Linux and the other Windows,
or the server machine is a non-IA machine, etc.),
then you need to download the latest
FLEXlm* daemons and utilities</A> for the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> 
machine before proceeding.</P>

where <b><code>&lt;server-install-dir&gt;</code></b> is the full path to 
the <b><code>flexlm</code></b> subdirectory containing the FLEXlm* daemons
and utilities for the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> platform type.
<p>
Yes, it is a little annoying to use full paths for the previous command.
You will find it useful if you ever have to track down where
a license manager resides in the file system from the output of
a <b><code>ps</code></b> command.
<P>
The Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* should now be operational.</P>
<P>
To make things easier, we recommend that you talk to your system
administrator, so that these daemons are automatically started
when the system is booted and stopped when the system is taken down. 
Show the system administrator the sections on this WEB page
about <a href="#StartingDaemons">starting</a> and
<a href="#StoppingDaemons">stopping</a>
license manager daemons, 
and the file: <B><CODE>lmgrd.intel.rc</CODE></B> from

The following sections contain various detailed information 
about existing license data files.  Yes, you can do these
tasks yourself, but it is a lot easier to ask your local FLEXlm*

<H4 TOC="Locate Server"><a name="Locate Server"></a>Determining Which Server is Running INTEL</H4>

<P>Login to the machine where you will install the License Server.
<B>cd</B> to the directory where the Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* distribution
file will be un<B>tar</B>'ed. Un<B>compress</B> (if necessary) and
un<B>tar</B> the Intel(R) License Manager for FLEXlm* distribution file. Look to see if
the command <B>lmutil</B> is present with the following command:</P>

<PRE><B>    find . -name lmutil -print</B></PRE>

<P>If <B>lmutil</B> is not present, then you need to download a
copy for this system type.</P>

<P><B>cd</B> to the directory that contains the <B>lmutil</B>
command. 
<p>
Make a copy of the <b><code>new-license-data-file</code></b> that you
created earlier in the current directory and call that file:
<b><code>temporary.lic</code></b>.
<p>
Edit <b><code>./temporary.lic</code></b>, changing the last group of digits on
the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line (the port number) 
to <b><code>0001</code></b>.  
If you want to keep the original form of the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> 
line around, any line that begins with a <b><code>#</code></b> character
is treated as a comment.
<p>
Then run the following command:

<PRE><B>    ./lmutil lmdiag -c ./temporary.lic</B></PRE>

It is important to use the <B>./lmutil</B> form of this command 
to make sure that you get the correct version of <B>lmutil</B> 
and not another version of <B>lmutil</B> that might happen to be 
on your path.</P>
<p>
You will get an output that looks something like:
<pre><b>    lmutil - Copyright (C) 1989-2001 Macrovision Corporation
    FLEXlm diagnostics on ...

    -----------------------------------------------------
    License file: temporary.lic
    -----------------------------------------------------

    </b>=== (lines edited out for brevity) ===<b>

    This license cannot be checked out because:
    Cannot connect to license server

	    ... I will try to determine what the problem is...

    ->Node &lt;server&gt; is UP and the network is working
    ->the lmgrd for this license file (1@&lt;server&gt;) does not respond

	This means that either the license servers were not
	started, or that lmgrd is running on another port.  If
	you would like to see if lmgrd is running on another port,
	choose the extended connection diagnostics.

     The extended connection diagnostics attempt to determine the
     reason you cannot connect to the license server.
     This process involves an attempt to connect to
     every port on the server node.  This operation can
     take a few minutes.

    Do you want to perform the extended connection diagnostics?: [y/n]:

</b>Answer:<b>y</b></PRE>
<p>
The utility will search all of the ports on the system
identified on the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line, 
looking for FLEXlm* license managers.  The utility will
provide a list of active ports, and tell you which ones
are FLEXlm* license managers.  If one of the FLEXlm* license
managers is serving licenses for your product, then it will
contain an entry mentioning the vendor daemon <b><code>INTEL</code></b>.
<p>
Here is a typical output for a system running a single FLEXlm*
license manager that is already serving licenses:
<pre><b>    Running extended connection diagnostics to host &lt;server&gt;

	     There is an lmgrd running on port 1710

    The vendor daemon "INTEL" is running with the lmgrd at port 1710
    This means that the port number in your license file (1)
    is wrong, and should be changed to 1710

    6 ports are listening, 1 of them are lmgrd processes
    Extended diagnostics done - all ports found reported above
    -----------------------------------------------------

    Enter &lt;CR&gt; to continue:

</b>Answer: <b>Control-C</b></PRE>
<p>
At this point, we know that the port number on the <b><code>SERVER</code></b>
line should be the number indicated in the output that YOU RECEIVE
(not the number 1710 from the above sample output).
Edit both <b><code>temporary.lic</code></b> and 
<b><code>new-license-data-file</code></b> and change the 
final group of digits on the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line 
to the new port number.
<p>

<h4 TOC="Locate License File"><a name="Locate License File"></a>Find the License File for this Server</h4>
<p>
Execute the following command:
<pre><b>    ./lmutil lmstat -c temporary.lic</b></pre>
<p>
Output from this command will look something like:
<pre><b>    Flexible License Manager status on ...

    License server status: ...
	License file(s) on &lt;server&gt;: &lt;server-license-file&gt;:

	  &lt;server&gt;: license server UP (MASTER) v9.2

    Vendor daemon status (on &lt;server&gt;):

	INTEL: UP v9.2
</b></pre>
Where <b><code>&lt;server&gt;</code></b> is the name of the 
system identified by
the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line in your license data, and 
where <b><code>&lt;server-license-file&gt;</code></b> is the full path to the 
license file that this license manager daemon is using.  
There may be more than one <b><code>server-license-file</code></b> listed.
<p>
You have two choices: either add another 
<b><code>server-license-file</code></b> to the 
configuration of this license manager daemon, or add your
license data to one of the existing <b><code>server-license-files</code></b>.  
In either case, you
have to discover who owns the license manager daemon. The best
way to do that is usually through the ownership of the
<b><code>server-license-files</code></b> that it uses.  
Use <b><code>ls -l</code></b> on
each <b><code>server-license-file</code></b> to discover that, 
or talk to your system administrator.
<p>
Adding another <b><code>server-license-file</code></b> to the 
configuration of the license
manager daemon is beyond the scope of this page.  If you want
to do this, ask for <a href="#Need Help">help</a>.

<h4 TOC="Edit License File"><a name="Edit License File"></a>Editing an Existing License Data File</h4>
<p>
Look through all of the listed license data files.
If only one references <b><code>INTEL</code></b>,
then select that one as the license data file to edit.
If more than one contains references to <b><code>INTEL</code></b>,
then pick the one that makes the most sense to you.
Otherwise, just pick any one of the listed 
<b><code>server-license-files</code></b>.
<p>
If the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line from the <b><code>new-license-data</code></b>
is EXACTLY the same as the existing <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line
(except for the port number), then
edit the selected license data file.  
Place the <b><code>new-license-data</code></b> at the end of the file.  
Comment out the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> 
line from the <b><code>new-license-data</code></b> by adding 
a <b><code>#</code></b> character to the front of the line.
<p>
If the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> lines are not comparable then you
must add another <b><code>server-license-file</code></b> to the 
configuration of the license manager daemon.

<h4 TOC="Daemon Versions"><a name="Daemon Versions"></a>Ensuring the Daemons Are the Right Version</h4>
<p>
Recall the output from the 
<b><code>./lmutil lmstat -c temporary.lic</code></b> command issued earlier:
<pre><b>    Flexible License Manager status on ...

    License server status: ...
	License file(s) on &lt;server&gt;: &lt;server-license-file&gt;:

	  &lt;server&gt;: license server UP (MASTER) v9.2

    Vendor daemon status (on &lt;server&gt;):

	INTEL: UP v9.2
</b></pre>
Check that:
<ul>
  <li>the license server is <b><code>UP</code></b>
  <li>the license server is version <b><code>v9.2</code></b> or higher
  <li><b><code>INTEL</code></b> is listed as a vendor daemon
  <li><b><code>INTEL</code></b> is <b><code>UP</code></b>
  <li><b><code>INTEL</code></b> is version <b><code>v9.2</code></b> or higher
</ul>
If the version number of the license server is too small,
then the license server must be upgraded.  
The <b><code>flexlm</code></b> subdirectory that contains the
<b><code>./lmutil</code></b> command also has a v9.2 license
server named: <b><code>lmgrd.intel</code></b>.  You have to
locate the code that causes this license server to execute.
Normally, your system manager is the person to ask, as
the license servers are started automatically at boot time.
<p>
If <b><code>INTEL</code></b> is not listed as a vendor daemon
then INTEL needs to be added to the available daemons.
Edit the selected license data file (the one you just added
the <b><code>new-license-data</code></b> to).
The current version of <b><code>INTEL</code></b> resides in the 
same directory as the <b><code>lmutil</code></b> command you have
been using on the machine identified by the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line.
To the end of the <b><code>VENDOR</code></b> line for the license data
you just added, append a blank, and then the full path to 
<b><code>INTEL</code></b>.
<p>
If the version number of <b><code>INTEL</code></b> is too small, then
the version of <b><code>INTEL</code></b> being run by the 
license server must be updated.
The current version of <b><code>INTEL</code></b> resides in the 
same directory as the <b><code>lmutil</code></b> command you have
been using on the machine identified by the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> line.
Edit all <b><code>server-license-files</code></b> 
that contain references to <b><code>INTEL</code></b>.
Comment out all <b><code>VENDOR</code></b> and <b><code>DAEMON</code></b>
lines that reference <b><code>INTEL</code></b> 
except for the <b><code>VENDOR</code></b> line
in the license data you just added. 
(Any line beginning # character is treated as a comment.)
To the end of the <b><code>VENDOR</code></b> line for the license data
you just added, append a blank, and then the full path to 
<b><code>INTEL</code></b>.

<h4 TOC="Reset Daemons"><a name="Reset Daemons"></a>Resetting the License Daemons</h4>
<p>
If you did not upgrade the license server to a new version,
then all you have to do is make the license server 
reread the files you edited.
Use the following command (execute once for each license file edited):
<pre><b>    ./lmutil lmreread -c &lt;license-file-you-edited&gt;</b></pre>

<h4 TOC="Restart Daemons"><a name="Restart Daemons"></a>Restarting the License Daemons</h4>
<p>
If you upgraded the license server, or are just a little 
paranoid about on-the-fly restart capabilities, you should
shut down the license server, and then start it up again.
Use the following command to shut down the license server:

<pre><b>    ./lmutil lmdown -c &lt;license-file-you-edited&gt;</b></pre>
<p>
Use the following command to start the license server (be sure to have a
<b><code>-c xxx</code></b> option for each existing license file):

<PRE><B>    &lt;server-install-dir&gt;/lmgrd.intel -c &lt;server-license-file&gt;</B></PRE>
where <b><code>&lt;server-install-dir&gt;</code></b> is the full path to 
the <b><code>flexlm</code></b> subdirectory containing the FLEXlm* daemons
and utilities for the <b><code>SERVER</code></b> platform type.
<p>
Yes, it is a little annoying to use full paths for the previous command.
You will find it useful if you ever have to track down where
a license manager resides in the file system from the output of
a <b><code>ps</code></b> command.
<P>

<h4 TOC="Status Check"><a name="Status Check"></a>Checking if the License Server is OK</h4>
<p>
Execute the command:
<pre><b>    ./lmutil lmstat -c temporary.lic</b></pre>
The output should be something like:
<pre><b>    Flexible License Manager status on ...

    License server status: ...
	License file(s) on &lt;server&gt;: &lt;server-license-file&gt;:

	  &lt;server&gt;: license server UP (MASTER) v9.2

    Vendor daemon status (on &lt;server&gt;):

	INTEL: UP v9.2
</b></pre>
Check:
<ul>
  <li>the license server is <b><code>UP</code></b>
  <li>the license server is version <b><code>v9.2</code></b> or higher
  <li><b><code>INTEL</code></b> is listed as a vendor daemon
  <li><b><code>INTEL</code></b> is <b><code>UP</code></b>
  <li><b><code>INTEL</code></b> is version <b><code>v9.2</code></b> or higher
</ul>
If these checks pass, then you have successfully added your
license data to the existing license file.
