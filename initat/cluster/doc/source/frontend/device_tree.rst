Device Tree
=======================

The device tree is the list of **device groups** and their associated **devices**. If the green check mark is shown above the device tree on the left side, you can use the device tree to **select and filter devices** you want to configure.

You can add, delete or restructure your devices and device groups here, within the limits of your licence. Device names do not have to be fully qualified domain names, the information how to reach a device over network is managed separately in  :ref:`networks` and :ref:`device_networks`.

If you want to add a new device, you should start here creating a new device in the according device group. In a second step, you need to add networking information about the device.
